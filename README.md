##  LEGO Detection & Classification Projects Used

- [**racketmaestro / Lego-motion-detection-and-image-recognition-ak-ag**](https://github.com/racketmaestro/Lego-motion-detection-and-image-recognition-ak-ag)  
  *Motion detection and classification*  
  Used as a reference for basic motion tracking.

- [**Billiam2468 / Lego-Brick-Sorter**](https://github.com/Billiam2468/Lego-Brick-Sorter)  
  *TensorFlow + OpenCV for sorting LEGO bricks into categories.*  
  Inspired my bin classification, especially the use of bounding boxes and color-based filtering. I refined it to balance color and size.

- [**F16oxy / Lego-detection-and-classification**](https://github.com/F16oxy/Lego-detection-and-classification)  
  *LEGO part detection and classification with OpenCV and TensorFlow.*  
  Helped me with edge cases in part recognition. I borrowed the preprocessing.
- [**enpit / tensorflow-for-lego**](https://github.com/enpit/tensorflow-for-lego)  
  *Exploring TensorFlow applications for LEGO recognition.*  
  Used as a check for model architecture and training. confirmed my approach was best.
